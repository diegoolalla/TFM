# Results Directory

This directory contains analysis results, visualizations, and evaluation metrics.

## Structure

- `visualizations/` - Plots, charts, and figures
- `metrics/` - Model performance metrics and evaluation results
- `reports/` - Generated analysis reports

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Large image files may not be committed** (see `.gitignore`)

### Visualizations

Store all plots and figures here:
- Exploratory data analysis plots
- Model performance visualizations
- Feature importance charts
- Confusion matrices
- ROC curves
- Learning curves

### Metrics

Store evaluation metrics in structured formats:
- CSV files with model comparison results
- JSON files with detailed metrics
- Performance reports

### Best Practices

1. Use descriptive filenames
2. Include timestamps or version numbers
3. Save plots in both display format (PNG) and vector format (PDF/SVG)
4. Document what each visualization shows
